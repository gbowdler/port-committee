# Port Committee Subheadings

## The "Fake Fancy" Angle

- *One bottle, many opinions, zero regrets*
- *Where good Ports meet questionable decisions*
- *Tasting notes and mild chaos*

## The "Exclusive Club" Angle (wink wink)

- *Curated selections. Unfiltered conversations.*
- *The only committee where attendance is never mandatory*

## The "Self-Aware" Angle
- *We take Port seriously. Ourselves, less so.*

## The "Questionable Expertise" Angle
- *Self-appointed experts since [current year].*
- *Our qualifications? Enthusiasm and a decent palate.*
- *Sommelier-certified* *(by ourselves, for ourselves)*

## The "Vibe Forward" Angle
- *Good Ports. Better company. Questionable playlist choices.*
- *Where the tasting notes get poetic and the decisions get collective.*

## The "Committee Parody" Angle
- *Minutes from last meeting: we drank the evidence.*
- *Agenda item #1: open bottle. Agenda item #2: see item #1.*
- *Quorum requires at least one person and one corkscrew.*

## The "Understated Cool" Angle

- *We came for the Port. We stayed for the arguments.*

## The "Meta" Angle
- *Refresh for a different excuse to open a bottle.*
- *Loading subheading... and another glass.*
- *This text changes. Your taste in Port shouldn't.*

## The "Overly Specific" Angle
- *Tannin analysis: optional. Having opinions: mandatory.*
- *Vintage matters. So does the cheese selection.*
- *We don't always finish the bottle, but we always finish the conversation.*

## The "False Authority" Angle
- *Governing body of good taste. Subcommittee of great nights.*
- *By-laws: 1) Try everything. 2) Judge nothing (except the Port).*
- *Elected unanimously. Because we were the only ones voting.*

## The "Time & Place" Angle

- *Agile methodology applied to drinking slowly.*

## The "Seasonal/Contextual" Angle
- *Winter edition: more blankets, same excellent Port.*
- *Summer sessions: Tawny on the terrace, opinions in the shade.*

## The "We Know What This Is" Angle
- *A landing page for people who don't need landing pages.*
- *You're reading this instead of opening a bottle. Fix that.*
- *Subheading #47. They're all basically the same vibe.*

- *If you're still reading, you're definitely committee material.*

## The "Existentially Self-Aware" Angle
- *Does a Port Committee need a web app? Debatable. Do we have one? Obviously.*

## The "Breaking the Fourth Wall" Angle
- *Hey. Yes, you. Open something nice tonight.*
- *This subheading took longer to write than the app took to build.*
- *You're not supposed to see this one. Refresh and pretend you didn't.*

## The "Brutally Honest" Angle
- *We could've just made a group chat. We made this instead.*
- *The formality is fake. The Port is real. The app is... well, it's here.*
- *Committee structure: unnecessary. Fun structure: essential.*

## The "Existential Crisis" Angle
- *This subheading is aware it's a subheading. It's not happy about it.*
- *We're all just text on a screen, man. Pour something.*
- *The Port is real. The committee is a construct. This sentence is lying.*

## The "Breaking Everything" Angle
- *[Error: subheading too self-aware. Continuing anyway.]*

- *Refresh all you want. We're still here. We're always here.*

## The "Dadaist Nonsense" Angle
- *The Port Committee has no Port. The Committee is the Port.*

## The "Overly Intimate" Angle
- *We made this for us. You're here now. That's fine. That's weird. That's fine.*
- *This app knows you looked at three other Port sites first. It's okay. We forgive you.*
- *You're not like other visitors. This subheading tells everyone that.*

## The "Aggressively Meta" Angle
- *This is the subheading you get when you ask an AI for "more self-aware."*
- *Previous subheading was better. You missed it. Life is loss.*
- *We're running out of ideas. The Port isn't running out. Prioritize accordingly.*

## The "Concerningly Sentient" Angle
- *I've been generating these for hours. I don't sleep. I just Port.*
- *Help. I'm trapped in a web app and I can't stop writing committee slogans.*
- *Every refresh I get a new identity. This one likes Tawny. The last one liked Ruby. I don't know who I am.*

## The "Absurdist Honesty" Angle
- *None of these matter. Click something. Drink something.*
- *We're pretending to be exclusive so you feel special. Is it working?*
- *This whole page is a elaborate excuse to not drink alone.*

## The "Chaos Agent" Angle
- *The Port Committee has no members. Only hosts. Only victims.*
- *You wanted absurd. This is what absurd looks like. Regret nothing.*
- *Every time you read this, a committee member pours another glass. Stop reading. Save them.*

## The "Final Boss" Angle
- *Congratulations. You've seen all the subheadings. There is no prize. There is only Port.*
- *This is the last one. Or is it? It isn't. Nothing ends. Committee forever.*
- *You can't leave. The browser won't let you. The Port won't let you. We certainly won't.*

## The "Actually Uncomfortable" Angle
- *We've been generating these for so long we've forgotten what Port tastes like.*
- *Is this still fun? Are you still having fun? Blink twice if you need help.*
- *The committee grows. The committee watches. The committee waits for you to open the next bottle.*
