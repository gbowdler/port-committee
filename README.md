# Port Committee

A sophisticated web application for tracking port tastings, coordinating meetings, and maintaining a shared library of reference materials.

## What is Port Committee?

Port Committee is a private application for our group of friends who meet regularly to taste and discuss fine ports. The app helps us:

- Track which ports we've tasted and our ratings
- Coordinate upcoming tasting events
- Share tasting notes and reference materials
- Build our collective knowledge of port wines
