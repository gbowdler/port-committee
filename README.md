# Port Committee

A sophisticated web application for tracking port tastings, coordinating meetings, and maintaining a shared library of reference materials. Features cinematic entrance videos, elegant transitions, and a refined browsing experience.

## What is Port Committee?

Port Committee is a private application for our group of friends who meet regularly to taste and discuss fine ports. The app helps us:

- Track which ports we've tasted and our ratings
- Coordinate upcoming tasting events
- Capture photos from each tasting session
- Share tasting notes and reference materials
- Build our collective knowledge of port wines

## Privacy & Security

- This is a private app for Port Committee members only
- Phone number authentication ensures only approved members can access
- All data is stored securely in Firebase (Google Cloud)
- Firebase security rules restrict access
- All members can view and edit all content (trust-based system)

## Troubleshooting

**Can't log in?**
Make sure your phone number is on the approved members list. Contact Gareth if you need to be added.

**SMS code not arriving?**
Wait up to 60 seconds. Check you entered the correct number starting with 07. Try again if needed.

**App won't load?**
Check your internet connection, try refreshing, or try a different browser.

**Can't upload files or photos?**
Make sure the file is under 5 MB and is a supported type. Check your internet connection.

**Entrance video not playing?**
The app will gracefully skip the video if it can't load (3s timeout on desktop, 5s on mobile). Content still appears normally without the video background.

**Video stuttering on mobile?**
This is rare but can happen on slower connections. The app automatically disables slow-motion effects on mobile to prevent stutter. Try on a stable Wi-Fi connection.

**Preview not working?**
PDFs require a modern browser. If preview fails, use the Download button instead.

**Data not saving?**
Ensure you have an internet connection. Try refreshing the page and re-entering data.

## Support

If you run into issues, ask in the Port Committee group chat or contact Gareth for technical help.
